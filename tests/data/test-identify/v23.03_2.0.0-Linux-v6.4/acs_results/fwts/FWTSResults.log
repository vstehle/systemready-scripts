uefivarinfo: UEFI variable info query.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: UEFI variable info query.
SKIPPED: Test 1, QueryVariableInfo UEFI runtime interface not supported: cannot
test.

ADVICE: Firmware also needs to check if the revision of system table is correct
or not. Linux kernel returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED as well, if the FirmwareRevision of
system table is less than EFI_2_00_SYSTEM_TABLE_REVISION.
